**Purpose:** 
This practice problem is to get familiarized with class creation, as well as the instantiation of objects in C#.</br>
We will create a Pen class which will have the following specification: </br>
**Properties:**
  1. “Brand”
  2. “Colour”
  3. “InkLevel”:Backing variable is a double representing mL.Validates that the value must be between 0 and “MaxInk” at all times.
  4. “MaxInk” :Double value representing mL.
  5. “HasLid” </br>
  
**Methods:**
“Write()” :Overloaded method that will either accept no parameters or a character count.
Subtract ink for the character count provided (one character equals 0.05mL of ink).
If the method is called with no parameters, assume the character count is 10.
Greedy and default constructors.</br>

Code written in Program.cs to test the functionality of your class.
